# Mango-Leaf-Disease-Image-Classifier

In this project I have used deep learning and Machine Learning models namely CNN, Random Forest Clssifier, Decision Tree classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier respecively.

Main aim of this project is to build an image classifier to predict the mango leaf disease types. 

#Getting Started
1. Download the file and try to run it in your colab notebook.
2. Install necessary libraries if not installed already (python 3.x , sckit learn, matplotlib etc.)
3. For getting the GUI framework I used a python librray Gradio which can be installed using command - "!pip install gradio".
